  <p>Variable interpolation is an important concept in shell scripting that enables users to reference and manipulate values stored in shell variables. It is a crucial skill for shell scripters and system administrators who need to automate tasks and write efficient shell scripts. This article provides an overview of variable interpolation and demonstrates how it works using two examples.</p>
  <h2>What is Variable Interpolation in Shell Scripting?</h2>
  <p>When referencing a variable in the shell, the syntax &lt;$variable-name&gt; is used. Variable interpolation occurs when this syntax is used in a command or script, and the value of the variable is substituted in its place. For example, if the variable name is assigned the value John, the command echo $name will output John.</p>
  <p>Variable interpolation can also be combined with other shell commands and operators to manipulate variables. For instance, the syntax ${variable-name:-default-value} can be used to provide a default value if the variable is not set. This is useful when writing scripts that need to handle missing or undefined variables. We will illustrate this with two examples:</p>
  <h2>Example 1: Merging Arrays</h2>
  <p>In this example, variable interpolation is used to merge two arrays. The first array and second array variables are defined and then merged using the $ syntax.</p>
  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
First_Array=("apple" "banana" "orange")
Second_Array=("pear" "grape")
All_Fruits=("${First_Array[@]}" "${Second_Array[@]}")
echo "All Fruits: ${All_Fruits[@]}"
  </code></pre>
  <p>Here is the output of the shell script that merges two arrays using variable interpolation:</p>
  <pre><code>All Fruits: apple banana orange pear grape</code></pre>
  <h2>Example 2: Handling Missing Variables</h2>
  <p>In this example, variable interpolation is used to check if a variable is undefined. The file name variable is checked to see if it is set. If it is not set, the default value named_file.txt is used instead.</p>
  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
if [ -z ${file_name+x} ]; then
  file_name="named_file.txt"
fi
echo "File Name: $file_name"
  </code></pre>
  <p>Here is the output of the shell script that declares a variable and adds a value to it if it is not set using variable interpolation:</p>
  <pre><code>File Name: named_file.txt</code></pre>
  <h2>Example 3: Using Variable Interpolation in Strings</h2>
  <p>Variable interpolation can be used to create dynamic strings. For example, suppose you want to create a greeting that addresses the user by name. You can use variable interpolation to substitute the user's name within the string:</p>
  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
user_name="John"
echo "Hello, $user_name! Welcome to my script."
  </code></pre>
  <p>Here is the output of the shell script that uses variable interpolation to create a dynamic greeting:</p>
  <pre><code>Hello, John! Welcome to my script.</code></pre>
  <h2>Example 4: Using Variable Interpolation in Arithmetic Operations</h2>
  <p>Variable interpolation can also be used in arithmetic operations to perform calculations. For example, suppose you want to calculate the sum of two variables. You can use variable interpolation to substitutethe variables within the arithmetic expression:</p>
  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
num1=5
num2=10
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum"
  </code></pre>
  <p>Here is the output of the shell script that uses variable interpolation to calculate the sum of two variables:</p>
  <pre><code>The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15</code></pre>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Variable interpolation is a powerful feature in shell scripting that allows users to reference and manipulate values stored in shell variables. By mastering variable interpolation, shell scripters and system administrators can write more efficient and reliable scripts.</p>
  <p>The examples provided in this article demonstrate how variable interpolation can be used to merge arrays, handle missing variables, create dynamic strings, and perform arithmetic operations. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, understanding variable interpolation is an essential skill for working with shell scripts or system administration.</p>
