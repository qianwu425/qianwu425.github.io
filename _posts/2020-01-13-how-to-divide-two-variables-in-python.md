    <p>Dividing two variables in Python is a basic operation when working with numerical data. In this article, we will discuss three methods for performing this operation in Python.</p>
    <h2>Dividing Two Variables in Python</h2>
    <p>The following are the three methods to divide two variables in Python:</p>
    <h2>Method 1: Using the "/" Operator</h2>
    <p>The "/" operator is used for division in Python, and it returns a floating-point result. Below is an example of how to use this operator:</p>
    <pre><code>x = 9
y = 3
# Divide using the "/" operator
result = x / y
print("Result: ", result)
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the code above, the value of "x" is divided by the value of "y" using the "/" operator. The result is saved in the "result" variable, which is then displayed on the console.</p>
    <h2>Method 2: Using the "//" Operator</h2>
    <p>The "//" operator is used for integer division in Python, and it produces a whole number result. Below is an example of how to use this operator:</p>
    <pre><code>x = 9
y = 3
# Divide using the "//" operator
result = x // y
print("Result: ", result)
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the code above, the value of "x" is divided by the value of "y" using the "//" operator. The result is saved in the "result" variable, which is then displayed on the console.</p>
    <h2>Method 3: Using the "divmod()" Function</h2>
    <p>The "divmod()" function returns the quotient and remainder of a division operation as a tuple. Below is an example of how to use this function:</p>
    <pre><code>x = 9
y = 3
# Divide using the "divmod()" function
result = divmod(x, y)
print("Result: ", result)
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the code above, the value of "x" is divided by the value of "y" using the "divmod()" function. The result is saved in the "result" variable, which is then displayed on the console.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Python offers multiple methods to divide two variables. In this article, we have discussed three methods - using the "/", "//", and "divmod()" functions. The choice of method depends on the specific needs of your code. These methods will help you perform division operations quickly and easily in your Python scripts.</p>
