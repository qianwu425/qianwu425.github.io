    <p>Bash is a popular command language and Unix shell that is widely used on different operating systems. One of its key features is the ability to customize script behavior using command-line parameters. The -ne operator is a conditional statement that plays a special role in Bash scripts.</p>
    <h2>What Does the -ne Operator Do in Bash?</h2>
    <p>The -ne operator is utilized in Bash scripts to check if two values are not equal. Conditional statements in Bash programs often rely on comparison processes, which make use of the -ne operator along with the test command. When the two values are not equal, the -ne operator returns true; otherwise, it returns false.</p>
    <h2>Example 1: Testing User Input</h2>
    <p>Consider the following code as an example. It prompts the user to input a number and then uses the -ne operator to determine if the number is less than 10:</p>
    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
    read -p "Please enter a number: " inputNum
    if [ $inputNum -ne 10 ]
    then
        echo "The number you entered is not equal to 10."
    else
        echo "The number you entered is 10."
    fi
    </code></pre>
    <p>When the user inputs a number other than 10, the script outputs "The number you entered is not equal to 10." If the user enters 10, the script outputs "The number you entered is 10."</p>
    <h2>Example 2: Evaluating Variable Values</h2>
    <p>In this example, the script uses the -ne operator to compare the value of a variable:</p>
    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
    num=20
    if [ $num -ne 5 ]
    then
        echo "The value of num is not equal to 5."
    fi
    </code></pre>
    <p>The script sets the value of $num to 20 and uses the -ne operator to determine if it is not equal to 5. Since 20 is not equal to 5, the script outputs "The value of num is not equal to 5."</p>
    <h2>Example 3: Using -ne with Strings</h2>
    <p>Bash scripts also use the -ne operator to compare strings:</p>
    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
    string1="hello"
    string2="world"
    if [ $string1 != $string2 ]
    then
        echo "The strings are not equal."
    fi
    </code></pre>
    <p>This example uses the -ne operator to compare two strings. Since "hello" and "world" are not equal, the script outputs "The strings are not equal."</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The -ne operator is an essential tool in Bash scripts for checking if two values are not equal. It is widely used in conditional statements to make decisions based on comparison results. The examples demonstrate how to use the -ne operator in Bash scripts to make decisions based on user input, variable values, and text comparisons. If you're new to Bash scripting, understanding the function of the -ne operator is crucial to mastering the language.</p>
