  <p>Compilers are essential programming tools that enable source code manipulation. Rustc is a popular compiler for the Rust programming language that preprocesses and compiles source code to create an executable file. This guide will take you through the process of installing and using rustc in Fedora.</p>
  <h2>Installing Rustc in Fedora</h2>
  <p>Rustc is a widely used compiler for the Rust programming language, and in this guide, we'll show you how to install it on your Fedora system. Follow these simple steps to install rustc:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo dnf update</code></pre>
  <p>First, update your system using the command above. This step ensures that your system is up to date and avoids any installation errors. Next, install rustc using the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo dnf install rustc</code></pre>
  <p>This command will install the Rust compiler using the official Fedora repositories.</p>
  <h2>Using Rustc in Fedora</h2>
  <p>Compiling .rs files with rustc is a simple process. Start by creating a new .rs file with the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo nano newfile.rs</code></pre>
  <p>This command opens the Nano text editor to create a new .rs file. Add the following code to the file:</p>
  <pre><code>fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}</code></pre>
  <p>This code will print "Hello, world!" to the console when executed.</p>
  <p>Save the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then run the following command to create an executable file:</p>
  <pre><code>rustc &lt;program-name&gt;.rs -o &lt;executable-filename&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>Replace &lt;program-name&gt; with the name of your .rs file and &lt;executable-filename&gt; with the name you want to give to the executable file. For example:</p>
  <pre><code>rustc newfile.rs -o newfile</code></pre>
  <p>This command compiles your code and creates an executable file named "newfile" in the same directory. To run the program, use the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>./newfile</code></pre>
  <h2>Uninstalling Rustc in Fedora</h2>
  <p>If you wish to uninstall rustc and any packages that depend on it, enter the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo dnf remove rustc</code></pre>
  <p>If you want to remove rustc only and keep the packages that depend on it, use the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo dnf remove --noautoremove rustc</code></pre>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Rustc is a powerful compiler that can help you create an executable file from your Rust code. It can be easily installed on Fedora using the official repository. We hope this guide has assisted you in successfully installing and using rustc on your Fedora system. If you decide to uninstall it, we have shown you how to do so.</p>
