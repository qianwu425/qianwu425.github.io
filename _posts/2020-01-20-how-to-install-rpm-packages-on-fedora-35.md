    <h2>Methods for Installing RPM Packages on Fedora 35</h2>
    <p>There are several methods you can use to install RPM packages on Fedora:</p>
    <h3>Method 1: Using dnf</h3>
    <p>You can use the following command to install an RPM package using dnf:</p>
    <code>sudo dnf install &lt;path to .rpm file&gt;</code>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <code>sudo dnf install /home/user/package.rpm</code>
    <p>To remove a package installed through dnf, use the following command:</p>
    <code>sudo dnf remove &lt;package-name&gt;</code>
    <h3>Method 2: Using rpm</h3>
    <p>Another method to install RPM packages is by using the rpm command-line utility. Use the following syntax:</p>
    <code>sudo rpm -i &lt;path to .rpm file&gt;</code>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <code>sudo rpm -i /home/user/package.rpm</code>
    <p>To remove a package installed through rpm, use the following command:</p>
    <code>sudo rpm -e &lt;package-name&gt;</code>
    <h3>Method 3: Using yum</h3>
    <p>You can also use the following command to install an RPM package using yum:</p>
