  <p>Make sure to replace <code>/usr/local/bin</code> with the path to the folder where npm is installed on your system.</p>
  <h3>Step 3: Update NPM</h3>
  <p>To update NPM to the latest version, run:</p>
  <code>sudo npm install -g npm</code>
  <p>This command will update NPM to the latest version.</p>
